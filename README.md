# ![icon](winfile.png) WinFile+

This permanent fork of Microsoft's WinFile is designed to be an enhanced version of what Microsoft originally [provided](https://github.com/Microsoft/winfile). The layout should stay the same, but enhancements will be made to be friendlier for modern users.

## Building WinFile+

Right now, the program is being designed to be built in ReactOS (Server 2003 or later), but it should be fairly easy to compile it elsewhere.

## History

The Windows File manager was originally released with Windows 3.0 in the early 1990s.  You can read more about the history at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Manager_(Windows).
